In this project I took an existing web page and made it more accesible and left the code a little better than I found it.
I added alt tags to all the images
I found all the HTML elements to be in order.
I also refactored the code to make it cleaner.
All the links in the Nav Bar brings you to a spot on the page. 
I believe this meets the criteria.
